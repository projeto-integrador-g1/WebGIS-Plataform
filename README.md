## What is this?

This is a project that aims to create an analysis of satellite image by means of AI,
making it able to identify plots of land.

## How it's going to work?

We are currently using and studiyng about techonologies that will be able to reach our
objective;

## Currently there are a few defined tools:

**[PostGIS](https://postgis.net/)** The database add that support geographic objects
allowing location queries to be run in SQL.

**[Keras](https://keras.io/) [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)** Neural network
that will be the core of the project written in Python and capable of running on top of
TensorFlow

**[WebGIS](http://www.webgis.com/) with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)** Will be used to
create an platform.

**Google Maps or OpenStreetMap** With [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) or
[Ploty](https://plot.ly/)

**[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) and
[GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/)** To develop back end tools such as CRUD.
